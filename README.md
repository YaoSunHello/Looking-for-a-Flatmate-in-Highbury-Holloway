# Looking-for-a-Flatmate-in-Highbury-Holloway
Hi! Iâ€™m looking for a like-minded flatmate to rent a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom flat together in the Highbury or Holloway area. Even though itâ€™s a rental, Iâ€™d love to create a cozy and stable home we both enjoy living in.

- **Budget**: Â£1250 per person/month (excluding bills)
  
- **Preferred location**: Highbury or Holloway
  
- **Move-in date**: Mid-July or later


**About Me**

I work full-time in the City (9â€“5, office-based), keep a regular routine, and love a clean, peaceful home. In my free time, I enjoy travelling, staying active, and spending time with friends. Iâ€™m hoping to find someone respectful, tidy, and easy-going to share a home with long-term.
